## Features
- Establish server-client communication using Python sockets.
- Demonstrates TCP and/or UDP protocol usage.
- Easy-to-understand examples suitable for beginners in networking.

---

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.6+**: Download and install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts (e.g., IP, ports).

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ptiwari6239/SocketWithPython.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SocketWithPython
   ```
3. Install any dependencies required (if any).

---

## Usage
1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
2. Start the client:
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact between the server and client.

---

## Code Overview
The project is structured as follows:
- **server.py**: Contains the implementation of the server-side socket.
- **client.py**: Contains the implementation of the client-side socket.
- Additional scripts or files (if present) may serve as utilities, tests, or configuration files.

---

## Examples
### Example 1: Basic Server-Client Communication
1. Start the server by running `server.py`.
2. Connect the client to the server by running `client.py`.
3. Send messages from the client to the server and observe the responses.
